This is the formalization accompanying the paper:

  Cezary Kaliszyk and Karol PÄ…k
  "Semantics of Mizar as an Isabelle Object Logic"

Submitted to J. Automated Reasoning.

The formalization is compatible with Isabelle 2017.

To switch between the dependency on Isabelle/FOL and
Isabelle/HOL, change the first line of 'mizar/mizar.thy'
to mention 'mizar_FOL' or 'mizar_HOL'.
